title: You're up and running!
---

The inspiration for the top title came from a song published today. That's a K-pop music called 'Pirate', sung by EVERGLOW. Just like this name, the song is aggressive. But the singers would like to express their energy and ambition, other than violence. I feel touched by one sentence inside 'Girls all over the world just get on board, and we could be anything!', that's a reflection of my mood this night.

Some hand-made work in Dec!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
