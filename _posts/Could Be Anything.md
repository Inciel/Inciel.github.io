title: Could Be Anything
---
The inspiration for the top title came from a song published today. That's a K-pop music called 'Pirate', sung by EVERGLOW. Just like this name, the song is aggressive. But the singers would like to express their energy and ambition, other than violence. I feel touched by one sentence inside 'Girls all over the world just get on board, and we could be anything!', that's a reflection of my mood this night.
